      <b>thinkContext</b> is the web browser extension which adds contextually relevant, politically progressive information to your web browsing.

      As you browse the web <b>thinkContext</b> consults several progressive data sources and if it finds anything relevant to what you are looking at it will unobtrusively add that information right into the page.  Look for the icons shown next to the data sources below and hover your mouse over them to show more information.  If you would like to change which data sources are used or change other aspects of <b>thinkContext</b>'s behavior please visit the Add-on options (Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions -> thinkContext -> Options).
