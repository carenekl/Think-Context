<h3>Hi, <a href="http://thinkcontext.org/">thinkContext</a> user!  You were an early adopter and now I could use your help in beta testing the next release.  In fact if you are reading this you already are running the latest beta (0.87).  

<p>

The changes should be relatively small but if you have any feedback (good or bad) please let me know at contact@thinkcontext.org

<p>Here's what's changed:

<ul>
<li>Behind the scenes, new data distribution server
<li>The semi-transparent news trackback icon that would appear in the bottom right of a news site has been moved to a url bar icon
<li>Also notifications about domains will no longer just appear in search engines but also on the domain itself.  There will be a popup dialog the first time the site is visited, as well as a url bar icon.
</ul>

<p>

If you don't want to run the beta anymore uninstall this version and install the version that's on <a href="http://thinkcontext.org/">thinkcontext.org</a>.
<p>
Thanks!
</h3>
